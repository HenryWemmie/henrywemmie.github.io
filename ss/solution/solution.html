  <h3>This is a very hard problem to solve, but there are a couple of ways to fix it. You can find all of these potential soluations detailed below.<h3>

    <h2 style="Color:Blue;"> ARGENTINA</h2>
    
    Oil production rates in Argentina have started to decline since 1998, and 90% of Argentina's electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. So in Argentina a goal was set for 8% of energy to be made from renewable energy sources by 2016. Solar energy is starting to be used as another way of getting energy. 200,000 truckloads worth of coal reaches the Earth in the form of solar energy per second, but the issue is that it gets spread out all over the place and is hard to extract. But solar panels and solar cells are able to absorb the energy and do it. To deal with the issue the San Juan province used the San Juan Solar Plant which is like a sunflower, tracking the sun's position in the sky to get energy from it. It isn't much right now, but its getting better everyday.
    
    
    <h2 style="Color:Blue;"> SADUI ARABIA</h2>
    
    The oil plantations around the east coast of Saudi Arabia are almost completely out of oil. Experts realized in 2010 that because of this the world may have reached Peak Oil in 2006, and the oil production did start going down after that, and it was directly linked to the oil reverses in Saudi Arabia. And if oil production keeps going down, then it will be the largest economical crisis ever and one of the worst energy crises ever. The three solutions to the problem are using something other than fossil fuels to make energy, using less energy, and using more renewable energy sources. Of course using less energy isn't going to be possible though because the demand for energy is doing nothing but rising. Because of Saudi Arabia being monoculture with oil it started to diversify and make more things including cement and fertilizer. The country even joined the World Trade Organization. And by 2020 10% of the country's energy was from solar power. A city in the red sea, called Thuwal, is running completely stable.
