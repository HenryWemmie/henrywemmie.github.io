      <h3><span class="hr3">Energy</span> is a pretty big issue. There are <span class="hr5">massive</span> <span class="hr3">energy</span> shortages all over the world, and <span class="hr3">energy</span> prices are on a rapid rise.
          Plus, with <span class="hr4">oil</span> and other <span class="hr4">fossil fuels</span> that are burned as <span class="hr3">energy</span> being horrible for the enviornment, things aren't always the best. But the good thing is that there are ways to solve this problem.
          But it won't be easy. But hopefully after seeing this website you will learn about more about the problems and solutions, and hopefullly help to solve some of these problems yourself.</h3>

      <h3>Texas is not doing the best in terms of <span class="hr3">energy</span> prices right now. Look up at the amount of money that it has cost to run this website. Now multiply that by 75. That's how bad it can be in Texas.
          Of course many people let out a sigh of relief as knowing that even though these problems are super bad they aren't anywhere near them. But with Texas being in the same country as us, that's not good.</h3>
