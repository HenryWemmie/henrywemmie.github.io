      <h3>Energy is a pretty big issue. There are giant energy shortages all over the world, and energy prices are on a rapid rise.
          Plus, with oil and oter fossil fuels that are burned as energy being horrible for the enviornment, things aren't always the best. But the good thing is that there are ways to solve this problem.
          But it won't be easy. But hopefully after seeing this website you will learn about more about the problems and soluations, and hopefullly help to solve some of these problems yourself.</h3>

      <h3>Texas is not doing the best in terms of energy prices right now. Imagine the amount of money that it has cost to run this website. Now multiply that by 75. That's how bad it can be in Texas.
          Of course many people let out a sigh of relief as knowing that even though these problems are super bad they aren't anywhere near them. But with Texas being in the same country as us, that's not good.
