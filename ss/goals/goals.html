      <p>#1; By 2030, ensurce access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy sources.</p>
      <p>#2; By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.</p>
      <p>#3; By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>#4; By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.</p>
      <p>#5; By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support.</p>
      
      
      
      <h1>STATISTICS ABOUT THE GOALS</h1>
      <ul>Progress has slowed in giving clean and affordable energy to everyone because the people who haven't been reached yet are harder to reach.<ul>
      <ul>In 2010 1.2 billion people had no electricity, but by 2020 that number has been reduced to 733 million, and at current ratese by 2030 it will be down to just 679 million people. Still a lot though.<ul>
      <ul>As of 2020, 2.4 billion people still use polluting cooking systems.<ul>
      <ul>As of 2019 only 17.7% of energy was clean and renewable energy.<ul>
      <ul>In 2017 countries spent $24.7 billion on the goal. In 2018 that number reduced to just $14.3 billion, and the last report was from 2019, which only had $10.9 billion spent on this goal.<ul>
      <ul>Progress in energy efficency will need to speed up in order to reach the current goals, because as of 2019 there was a 1.9% energy-intensity improvement rate, but by 2030 it needs to be 3.2%.<ul>
